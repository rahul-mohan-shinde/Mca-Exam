Got it 👍 — for **5 marks**, you need a **bit detailed, well-structured answer**.

Here is a **proper 5-mark exam answer** on **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**:

## 📘 Django Rest Framework (DRF)

**Django Rest Framework (DRF)** is a powerful and flexible framework built on top of the Django web framework for developing **RESTful Web APIs**. It simplifies the process of creating APIs that allow different applications such as web apps, mobile apps, and desktop systems to communicate with a backend server.

DRF provides a structured way to convert complex Django model data into formats like **JSON, XML, and HTML** using **Serializers**. These serializers handle both data validation and transformation, making API development faster and more reliable. It also supports **class-based views**, **ViewSets**, and **routers**, which reduce boilerplate code and improve maintainability.

One of the major strengths of DRF is its built-in support for **authentication and authorization**. It offers multiple authentication methods such as **Session Authentication, Token Authentication, and JWT**, along with a flexible **permission system** to control access to APIs. This makes DRF suitable for building secure applications.

DRF also includes advanced features such as **pagination, filtering, throttling, and versioning**, which help in handling large datasets, improving performance, and managing API usage. In addition, it provides a **Browsable API interface**, which allows developers to test and interact with APIs directly through a web browser without using external tools.

Overall, Django Rest Framework enables developers to build **scalable, secure, and maintainable REST APIs** efficiently while fully utilizing Django’s ORM, middleware, and ecosystem.
